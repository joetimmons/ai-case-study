# TITLE
**Ginkgo Bioworks - At the Intersection of AI and Biology

## Overview and Origin
Ginkgo Bioworks provides an “AI powered” biotechnology platform & services to their customers. Specifically they offer enzyme services, protein services, metabolic engineering services, strain optimization services, & biosecurity 
The company was founded in 2008 and is based in Boston, Massachusetts. The company was founded by Tom Knight, Jason Kelly, Reshma Shetty, Barry Canton, and Austin Che. 

The backstory to how Ginkgo was founded was that the fellow MIT graduate co-founders were both bored by job prospects available to them in the economic downturn of 2008 coupled with none of them wanted to pursue a postdoc degree - so Ginkgo was really born out of a lack of alternatives with a desire to do something cool between computation and biology. Grants and awards from government agencies, including the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, jump-started Ginkgo in its nascent years.
As Ginkgo scaled as a private company they raised over $726M in total funding and went public via a SPAC in September 2021 raising another 1.6B. 

## Business Activities
The company helps customers across a range of industries from chemical innovation to fragrance development to cannabis production — to discover and scale microbe-based solutions that have the potential to reduce production costs and improve manufacturing efficiency.
By combining advanced lab techniques and proprietary software and AI, Ginkgo can assist in boosting a client company’s R&D speed and capabilities.
Ginkgo’s labs designed as a data creation engine are their strategic advantage, called Ginkgo’s “foundries”, engineer organisms using the company’s proprietary software. This software swiftly codes thousands of prototypes using machine-learning tools, and the custom-engineered foundry hardware automatically processes the corresponding lab work at a massive scale capturing all of the related data into Ginko’s internal Codebase. The Codebase allows researchers to select the cell design that best fulfills client needs. The technology stack Ginkgo uses internally includes leveraging both Amazon Web Services & Google Cloud for compute resources (GPU training) as well as interpretation and analysis via their bio software engineers who are typically proficient in python and R. 
Ginkgo generates revenue by designing cells and scaling production up to commercial levels for clients. Ginkgo also partners with companies that want to use its technology. In doing so, Ginkgo pairs its biotech expertise with a partner’s industry-specific knowledge, so that both may benefit Once a partner’s commercial production starts, Ginkgo typically receives a share of sales royalties through licensing agreements.
Alternatively, Ginkgo may stand to earn payments from designing cells that allow clients to satisfy predetermined conditions or clear research hurdles. For instance, Cronos, a global producer and distributor of medical marijuana and cannabinoid oil, has agreed to pay Ginkgo up to $600,000 per discovery upon hitting R&D targets.
Intellectual property (IP) ownership varies by client. In its relationship with Cronos, for example, Ginkgo owns all IP except for that which relates to usage, dosage, and application of Cronos’ cannabinoid products.
Ginkgo competes with companies that leverage machine learning and automation to bioengineer organisms. In the synthetic biology space, the company has raised more funding and established more corporate partnerships than its peers.

## Landscape
Ginkgo primarily sells its services to the biotechnology sector. Specifically you would classify Ginkgo as sitting in the intersection of complex biology and computational biology with their advanced use of both labs + machine learning and AI. The larger trends in computational biology over the past 5-10 years has been a story of how as computers (and machine learning) has become more complex and capable, biological data can be fused with computation to train machine learning models to simulate lab work with a high degree of accuracy saving weeks or months of work in therapeutic processes which used to take up to a decade to complete. 

Some other interesting computational biology/ AI based drug discovery companies include Absci , Regeneron, Terray Therapeutics and Synthego. 

## Results
Ginkgo Bioworks since they have gone public have grown their quarterly revenues from 44 million dollars to over 80 million dollars in their latest quarter in 2023. 
Ginkgo calls each of its active customer contracts a “program” and publicly shares their progress by customer industry category in every quarterly earnings release. In terms of progress in Q1 2021 Ginkgo shared that they had 44 total customer projects compared to Q2 2023 they had grown that number to 105. 
As unusual as it sounds, Ginkgo has no 1:1 competitor. The “biology platform” data approach they are building is not directly offered by any other company worldwide. In multiple interviews company representatives have indicated that their biggest competitor when selling to prospective customers is the “status quo” of the customers R&D team continuing to do the lab work in house. 
However, having said that, there are a few niche competitors that have a partial competitive nature to Ginkgo. Some of these include Synthetic Genomics founded by Craig Venter who is known for leading one of the first teams to map the human genome in 2000. Other seed- and early-stage peers include UK-based Synthace, Canada-based MetaMixis, Germany-based Synbionik, and fellow Massachusetts-based enEvolv. As a competitive cohort none of these semi-competitors have gained much commercial transaction and are all still private so gauging specific revenue and profitability is extremely difficult compared to Ginkgo who has a market value of roughly 2.5b today. 

## Recommendations
If I were advising Ginkgo I would advise them to consider building a biology data and machine learning model “app store” from their proprietary datasets. Their datasets could unlock tremendous value for all sorts of new applications in biotechnology companies looking to train niche machine learning models and/or massive large language models to fit their internal efficiency or core product therapeutic / drug discovery goals. 

<blockquote>I believe a Ginkgo App & Data Digital Store would contribute net new revenue in a low friction / low sales investment way given that customers could self service their needs by browsing what datasets and or ml models. They could use a similar revenue share model as Apple whereas they also allow 3rd party publishers to publish biology data or models as well with Ginkgo taking a 30% share of the associated one time or recurring fees for usage.
